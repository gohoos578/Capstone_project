    "Manhattan has lot more high-density neighborhoods in terms of number of venues: Among the 938 restaurants from Foursquare search across the 40 neighborhoods in Manhattan, Greenwich Village, Chinatown, and East Village are the most competitive neighborhoods with the highest number of restaurants. Stuyvesant Town, Roosevelt Island, Marble Hill, Morningside Heights, and Battery Park City are not least competitive.\n",

    "Manhattan has widest selection of foods from the world: Manhattan has 75 different kinds of restaurants among the 938 restaurants searched. Italian, American, Mexican, and French restaurants have the most representations, with 14%, 8%, 6%, and 6% respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "k-mean machine learning methodology is used to cluster Manhattan neighborhoods into 5. Battery Park, Carnegie Hall, and Little Italy, stand out with their unique food offerings. The largest cluster, in red dots on the cluster map, includes 20 neighborhoods which offers the most diversity selection of European food, Middle Eastern food, and Southeast Asian food, with pop of specialty food such as Falafel. The last cluster, in blue dots, has the most selection of Asian and Latin American restaurants, with food ranging from dim sum, ramen, sushi, dumpling, to tacos.\n",

    "Please note that unique venue categories are not necessary the mutually exclusive categories. For example, there are 24 venues just listed as 'Restaurant' without specify which type of restaurants or what type of food serving. Thus, further analysis of more accurate venue categories might affect neighborhood clustering."

This high-income neighborhood surrounded by banks and financial firms at Wall Street, is currently not as competitive as other neighborhoods in terms of total restaurants available. Also, the neighborhood does not offer many selection of French restaurants from the result of the top 10 venue, in contrast with French restaurant as the 4th most popular restaurant in Manhattan."
